The Head of Data Analytics has tasked me with providing insights to support the business team in making a compelling case for activating a new vendor— a leasing company. Intuitively, the vehicles this vendor would send to Company X would follow the typical ex-leasing segment, characterized by lower age, lower mileage, and mid-to-high-end models. I am expected to analyze the provided dataset, which contains both fictional internal transaction data (since January 2024) and fictional external benchmarking data (e.g., B2B prices), to extract relevant insights regarding Company X’s performance for the segment of interest.

Deliverables:
• Jupiter notebook  with the various steps specifically noted.
• PowerPoint slide with a summary of key findings that are relevant to the business purpose.
